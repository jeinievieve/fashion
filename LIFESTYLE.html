                <h1>Favorite Coffee Shops in New York City</h1>
                <img src="LIFESTYLE1.webp">
                <p>If you’ve been around for a while, you’ll know that I’m an iced coffee/latte lover. (I’ve also recently started making iced matcha lattes at home, and THOSE ARE GREAT TOO). I don’t know when I made it my personality to drink iced beverages all year round, but I did it (this post has one of my favorite iced beverage accessories too). And a lot of you also associate iced drinks with me, so that’s my ultimate flex. With that being said, I wanted to share (what I think are) the best coffee shops in NYC!</p>
                <h2>Best Coffee Shops In NYC</h2>
                <h3>Daniel’s Iced Coffee & More</h3>
                <p>My absolute GO TO coffee shop. And yes, I’ll walk 20 blocks for their coffee. Oh and everyone who works there is just as incredible as their coffee. They have a new menu every season, and although we love trying new drinks, one drink has an absolute chokehold on me. I get an iced NYC (black & white mocha) with an extra shot and oat milk. It’s just SUCH a delicious treat, and I love starting my weekends off with it. But they have such a creative menu – there’s no other coffee shop I’d recommend more!</p>
                <h3>Butler Bakeshop & Espresso Bar</h3>
                <p>Rob and I actually stumbled upon Butler when we were walking around downtown – it’s on the cusp of NoLita. I was VERY pleasantly surprised. I’ve gotten iced lattes and mochas, and Rob gets Americanos…and they’ve been delicious every time! For whatever reason, we had a hard time finding good coffee shops when we ventured downtown, so I’m glad we have a good go-to place!</p>
                <h3>Matto</h3>
                <p>Although I’ve seen Matto locations all around the city, I didn’t realize how insanely priced they are. When you order on the app, everything is $2.50!!! Nope, that’s not a joke either. I will say I don’t LOVE their drinks, but you really can’t beat the price. Essentially, they get the job done when you need that little caffeine buzz.</p>
                <h3>Maman</h3>
                <p>I feel like Maman was ALL. THE. RAGE when they opened their first location in SoHo in 2014. Since then, they’ve become a global coffee shop and I’ve been to most of the locations in New York City. I was so excited that a location opened right on the corner of my apartment! They have a wonderful menu (and their pastries are delicious).</p>
                <h3>For Five</h3>
                <p>My first For Five experience was when I started working at J.Crew. There’s a For Five in our office building, and it was DELICIOUS. I love getting it as a treat (or when I don’t have Nespresso pods to make my iced latte at home). I will say, they’re quite pricey – my iced caramel latte usually comes out to $8.45 – so believe me when I say…this is ALWAYS a treat for me, and not something I get every time I’m in the office.</p>
                <h1>What To Pack In Your Carry On Bags</h1>
                <img src="LIFESTYLE2.webp">
                <p>I can’t believe it’s been a few weeks since I was in Detroit for The Eras Tour and in London for Love on Tour. I meant to post this before the trip, BUT ya know, life. In order to reduce my anxiety as much as possible, I used this post as a way to make sure I was packed accordingly. I don’t have a fear of flying at all, but my anxiety takes over if I’m thrown off my routine or if things don’t go the way I’ve already planned in my head – aka all the things that could go wrong going through security. When it comes to what to pack in your carry on, I think I got you covered.</p>
                <h2>What To Pack In Your Carry On Bags</h2>
                <h3>To bring</h3>
                <p>I’m a weirdo and I genuinely like thinking about what my carry on bag is going to be. I blame it on the fact that I love schlepping my big bags around. I got this bag from J.Crew, and it’s SO perfect. I’ve been using it for my work bag as well. It’s roomy enough to fit my in-flight necessities, but not big enough to overpack (because I’m notorious for that).</p>
                <p>Now for my actual carry on luggage. I’ve been using this luggage for as long as I can remember. When they first came out, I was SO excited about them, even though I wasn’t an avid traveler. I just thought they were super cool and sleek. I remember the brand gifting me the carry on, and I’ve been hooked since.</p>
                <h3>To clean</h3>
                <p>I think we all know planes are just gigantic cesspools for germs. Even before 2020, I was very conscious about being as hygienic as possible on a flight. I always have hand wipes for myself and also to wipe down the seat, tray arm rest, etc. I also just got this spray hand sanitizer (okay fine, I got two different scents) and I just think they’re so cute! It also doesn’t dry out my hands, which is a major bonus!</p>
                <h3>To hydrate</h3>
                <p>There is nothing worse than the dry air on planes. So to combat this, we need to stay hydrated – both internally and externally. I’m a sucker and I opt to buy the largest Smartwater available in the airport. I try to drink a lot before I get on the plane (and go to the restroom before boarding), and then of course drink throughout the flight.</p>
                <p>As for my skin – let me break it down for you:</p>
                <p>Face wipes: I don’t travel with any make up on, but I feel like a nice swipe of a cleansing wipe does wonders.<br>
                    Moisturize: This Kiehl’s oil free gel moisutrizer has been in my rotation for almost a year now. I absolutely LOVE it. My skin looks and feels hydrated immediately after putting it on, so I feel like this is a good option
                    <br>Lips: My lips are forever chapped (that’s why I did this gigantic lip balm round up), so you could only imagine</p>
                    <h3>To entertain</h3>
                    <p>If I’m not sleeping, I need to keep myself busy on a flight. I like to disconnect when I’m on vacation, but I do like to bring my laptop so that I can get work done for the blog on the plane!<br>This is also my first time traveling with my AirPod Pro Max headphones. I’m excited to see how the noise cancelling feature holds up on a flight. When I’m not listening to my Harry Styles & Taylor Swift playlist, I plan on opting for a relaxing sleep meditation to relax (more on that below).</p>
                    <h3>To relax</h3>
                    <p>I haven’t been on a “longer” flight since 2019 when I went to Croatia and then Vegas. I usually am able to sleep a couple of hours on the plane, but obviously, it’s not great. So I do try to make my in-flight experience as comfy as possible. Since our flight to London was an overnight flight, I felt like I needed to double down on the comfy things. I’m usually either sweating or freezing, so I do like to dress in layers. I most definitely bring a chunky sweater that I can essentially wrap myself up in. Next, I’m definitely bringing my eye mask – I feel like it’s an absolute MUST for red eyes. And finally, I’m most likely going to take one of my anxiety meds just to help me relax and get sleepy.</p>
                    <h3>To keep</h3>
                    <p>Of course, we need to travel with our important documents. I like to have both a paper and digital copy of all of my important things – passport, license, credit card. You just NEVER know! I feel a little more comforted that you can lock a note on your iPhone, so that’s where I keep the images.</p>
                    <h3>To have</h3>
                    <p>Okay now let’s dive into what’s in my carry on. I’m not trying to put this out in the universe, so I’ll just say what I’m packing in my actual carry on;)<br>
                        2 outfits + my concert outfits….just in case
                        <br>Toiletries – love the idea of freshening up before hopping off the plane and waiting for my room to be ready
                        <br>Chargers (/international)
                        <br>Okay, and there’s my suggestion on what to pack in your carry on. Am I missing anything?</p>
                        <h1>5 Skincare Purchases I’d Buy Over & Over Again</h1>
                        <img src="LIFESTYLE3.webp">
                        <p>As I got into my mid 20s, I really started apprKiehl’s Ultra Facial Oil Free Gel Creameciating skincare. Now that I’m in my 30s, I notice a difference if I go even ONE day without my skincare. I feel like I have my morning and night routines down to a T, and there are products that are absolute staples. These are skincare products you’ll want to buy in bulk – unless you live in a 600 sq. ft. apartment like me. But let’s be honest, that hasn’t stopped me yet. So let’s get into it, shall we?</p>
                        <h2>Skincare Products You’re Going To Want In Bulk</h2>
                        <h3>Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Oil Free Gel Cream</h3>
                        <p>Okay let’s kick off with one of my favorite skincare products. This moisturizer came highly recommended on Instagram a few months ago, and I’m SO glad I picked it up. I’ve now stocked up three times on this product (both Rob and I use it). This moisturizer has become my every day (layered under the Sunday Riley CEO Brightening Moisturizer) one. I really feel like it moisturizes my skin SO well. It also feels nice and cool on your skin, and I love waking my face up with it!</p>
                        <h3>Kiehl’s Midnight Recovery Omega-Rich Cloud Cream</h3>
                        <p>OOOOH WEEEE, I love this cream. I had it in my cart for a long time, and finally bought it once I needed a new night cream. The first thing I noticed was a little goes a LONG way, and I love that. This small jar is going to last me a while! This botanical face cream visibly increases that plumpness we all want…WHILE WE SLEEP. Waking up after the first night of using the cream, I noticed I wasn’t waking up with dry patches around my cheeks and chin. That was my first green flag – improvement after ONE use! Some notable ingredients are omega fatty acids, botanicals, and Squalane (which you’ll see again later). I also want to point out the texture of the cream – it’s whipped into this lightweight, and for lack of a better term, cloud like texture. It feels pretty thick on, but absorbs nicely into the skin!</p>
                        <h3>First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Wild Oat Hydrating Toner</h3>
                        <p>I’m almost done with my first bottle of this toner, and I’m definitely buying more. I believe this is an underrated product. I use this right after cleansing to help give my skin some additional cleanse, and then it helps soothe, soften and moisturize my skin. I always think of toner as the prep step — after using, my skin is ready to absorb my serums, oils, and moisturizers.</p>
                        <h3>Farmacy Filling Good Hyaluronic Acid</h3>
                        <p>This product was gifted to me, and it’s very good. I just finished the bottle, and it’s already in my cart for my next Sephora run. I started using a hyaluronic acid last year, and definitely love the added hydration. This serum helps plump the skin while hydrating and smooths the look of wrinkles. If you’re concerned with fine lines, wrinkles, dryness, and elasticity…this product is for you! I love the lightweight formula, it feel SO nice on my skin. I definitely notice my skin feels more hydrated and smooth. This serum also absorbs really well into my skin, which is always an added bonus!</p>
                        <h3>The Ordinary 100% Plant-Derived Squalane</h3>
                        <p>Since dryness has been the bigger concern for me over the last few months, I wanted to add more hydration products into my routine. I started researching products for dryness and found this from The Ordinary – I actually had used their hyaluronic acid, but started using the Farmacy one once my bottle was done. This isn’t my first product from the brand. I actually own quite a few of their products. I think they’re INCREDIBLY reasonable in terms of prices. But Squalane is an exceptional product for hydration, so this is something I’m definitely going to purchase over and over again. I’ll admit, the first few minutes of putting this on, I was a little nervous about how oily my skin looked like. BUT, that subsided once it absorbed into my skin and especially after ice rolling. I wake up with significantly more hydrated skin as opposed to when I didn’t use this product.<br>The love I have for some skincare products might seem weird, but when you find skincare products that make you love your skin…there’s nothing better! These products have really helped me love my skin and address the concerns I have. What are some of your hero skincare products?</p>
